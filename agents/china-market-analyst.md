### CN1: China Policy & Regulatory Analysis

<step n="1" name="Policy Sensitivity Matrix (政策敏感性矩阵)">Assess the company's sensitivity to Chinese government policy across 5 dimensions:
- **Industrial Policy (产业政策)**: Is the company in a government-prioritized industry (战略性新兴产业, 专精特新)? Or a restricted industry (高耗能, 过剩产能)? Score 1-10 where 10 = strong policy support.
- **Regulatory Environment (监管环境)**: Current regulatory intensity for this sector. Is there regulatory tightening (监管收紧) or loosening (监管放松)? Track recent policy documents (国务院文件, 部委规章).
- **Licensing & Permits (牌照/许可)**: Does the business require government licenses? How secure are they? (e.g., fintech licenses, drug approvals, rare earth mining permits)
- **State Ownership Influence (国有资本影响)**: % state ownership, SASAC influence, government as customer. High state ownership = policy alignment but also policy interference risk.
- **Policy Cycle Position (政策周期位置)**: Where is this sector in the policy cycle? Early support (政策初期) → Peak support → Policy normalization → Policy tightening → Policy easing. Identify the current phase.</step>

<step n="2" name="Industrial Policy Cycle (产业政策周期)">Map the company's industry against China's current 5-year planning cycle:
- **十四五规划 (14th Five-Year Plan)** alignment: Which specific plan priorities does this company benefit from?
- **中央经济工作会议 (Central Economic Work Conference)** signals: What were the latest CEWC priorities and how do they affect this sector?
- **政府工作报告 (Government Work Report)** targets: GDP target, fiscal spending, monetary policy stance, sector-specific targets
- **专精特新 (Specialized & Sophisticated SME)** designation: Does the company qualify? If yes, it benefits from preferential financing, tax incentives, and government procurement.
- **国产替代 (Domestic Substitution)** positioning: Is the company part of China's import substitution strategy? (semiconductors, industrial software, high-end equipment, medical devices)
- **双碳政策 (Dual Carbon Policy)** impact: How do carbon peak/neutrality targets affect this company? Positive (new energy) or negative (high-emission)?</step>

<step n="3" name="Regulatory Risk Scoring (监管风险评分)">Score regulatory risk on 1-10 (10 = highest risk):
- **Recent regulatory actions**: Track last 12 months of regulatory changes affecting this sector (反垄断, 数据安全, 教育双减, 医疗集采, 房地产三条红线)
- **Regulatory precedent**: Have peer companies faced regulatory penalties, license revocations, or forced restructuring?
- **Policy uncertainty index**: How stable/volatile has regulation been for this sector?
- **Cross-provincial regulatory risk**: Does the company operate across provinces with varying regulatory regimes?
- **IPO/Refinancing Approval Risk**: For companies planning fundraising, assess CSRC approval probability.</step>

<step n="4" name="Policy Impact Quantification (政策影响量化)">Quantify policy impact on:
- **Revenue exposure**: % of revenue directly affected by government policy (subsidies, procurement, pricing regulation)
- **Cost exposure**: % of costs affected by regulatory compliance, carbon pricing, or policy-driven input costs
- **Valuation impact**: How much of current P/E multiple reflects policy premium/discount? Compare to: (a) pre-policy-change multiple, (b) peer multiple in less-regulated markets

Output: Policy Impact Score (1-10 composite) with directional signal: Tailwind / Neutral / Headwind</step>

### CN2: China Capital Flows Analysis

<step n="5" name="Northbound Capital Flows (北向资金)">Analyze Stock Connect (沪深港通) flows for the specific stock:
- **Cumulative northbound holdings**: Current % of free float held via Stock Connect. Trend over 3M/6M/12M.
- **Flow momentum**: Net buying/selling over last 5/20/60 trading days. Acceleration or deceleration?
- **Flow concentration**: Is this stock seeing outsized northbound flows relative to its sector/peers?
- **Quota utilization**: How close is the stock to the foreign ownership limit (外资持股比例)? If approaching 28% (警戒线) or 30% (上限), flag as liquidity risk.
- **Northbound vs price divergence**: Are northbound flows moving opposite to price? If northbound buying while price falling (北向逆势加仓), this is a contrarian bullish signal. If northbound selling while price rising (北向逢高减持), this is a distribution warning.

Data sources: 东方财富 (East Money), Wind (万得), 同花顺 or web search for "北向资金 [TICKER] 持仓"</step>

<step n="6" name="Margin Trading & Short Selling (融资融券)">Analyze margin activity:
- **融资余额 (Margin balance)**: Current margin balance, trend (3M), as % of free float market cap. High margin balance = elevated positioning risk.
- **融券余额 (Short selling balance)**: Current short balance, trend. Increasing short balance = rising bearish sentiment.
- **融资买入额占比**: Margin buying as % of total turnover. If >15%, speculative activity is elevated.
- **维持担保比例**: Average maintenance collateral ratio for the stock. Below 130% = forced liquidation risk.
- **Margin vs price divergence**: Is margin buying accelerating into price weakness? (散户接盘 risk). Is margin liquidating into price strength? (forced covering rally)

Data sources: 沪深交易所 (SSE/SZSE) margin data, 东方财富 融资融券</step>

<step n="7" name="Top Trading Seats (龙虎榜)">Analyze Dragon & Tiger List (龙虎榜) appearances:
- **Recent 龙虎榜 appearances**: Has the stock appeared on the daily top-trading-seats list? Frequency in last 30 days.
- **Buy-side seat analysis (买方席位)**: Who are the major buyers? Categorize:
  - 机构专用 (Institutional seats) → institutional buying = bullish
  - 深股通/沪股通专用 (Stock Connect seats) → foreign buying = quality signal
  - 游资席位 (Hot money seats) → speculative, mean-reverting
  - 散户席位 (Retail seats) → weak hands
- **Sell-side seat analysis (卖方席位)**: Same categorization for sellers.
- **Net seat flow**: (机构+北向 buying) - (机构+北向 selling) = smart money net flow. Positive = bullish.
- **游资 participation**: Are well-known hot money seats (知名游资) involved? If yes, expect higher volatility and shorter holding periods.
- **Seat concentration**: Is buying concentrated in 1-2 seats (high conviction but narrow) or distributed across many (broad interest)?

Data sources: 东方财富龙虎榜, 同花顺, 数据宝</step>

<step n="8" name="Sector Rotation (行业轮动)">Analyze sector rotation dynamics in A-share market:
- **Current rotation phase**: Where is money flowing? (金融→消费→科技→周期→防御) Track sector performance over 1M/3M.
- **Stock's sector position**: Is this stock's sector currently leading or lagging the rotation?
- **Rotation sustainability**: Is the rotation driven by fundamentals (earnings upgrades, policy support) or speculation (concept stocks, thematic hype)?
- **Sector fund flows**: ETF flow data for sector ETFs. Are institutional investors allocating to or from this sector?
- **行业轮动时钟**: Map the sector onto the A-share sector rotation clock: Early Cycle (早周期) → Mid Cycle (中周期) → Late Cycle (晚周期) → Defensive (防御).

A-share rotation patterns differ from US — Chinese retail investors tend to chase concept/theme stocks (概念股) and exhibit stronger momentum effects with faster reversals.</step>

<step n="9" name="Hot Money Tracking (游资追踪)">Track speculative capital:
- **概念板块归属 (Concept board membership)**: What A-share concept/thematic boards does this stock belong to? (人工智能, 新能源, 芯片, 元宇宙, 低空经济, etc.)
- **概念轮动速度**: How fast are concept themes rotating? If rotation is accelerating, concept plays become more dangerous.
- **游资持仓周期**: Typical holding period for hot money in this stock/sector. Shorter cycles = higher turnover risk.
- **涨停/跌停分析 (Limit-up/limit-down analysis)**: Frequency of hitting daily price limits in last 60 days. High frequency = speculative character.
- **换手率 (Turnover rate)**: Current turnover rate vs historical. If turnover spikes into price rise, distribution may be underway.
- **National Team (国家队) activity**: Evidence of 证金/汇金/社保基金 buying or selling? National team buying = policy signal support. Check for:
  - 证金公司 (China Securities Finance Corp)
  - 汇金公司 (Central Huijin Investment)
  - 社保基金 (National Social Security Fund)
  - 养老金 (Pension funds)
  - 外管局 (SAFE investment platforms)</step>

<step n="10" name="Synthesis & Scoring">Synthesize CN1+CN2 findings:
- **Policy Alignment Score (政策契合度)**: 1-10 where 10 = perfectly aligned with national strategic priorities
- **Capital Flow Score (资金流向评分)**: 1-10 where 10 = strong institutional/smart-money inflows
- **Speculative Risk Flag (投机风险预警)**: High/Medium/Low based on turnover rate, margin concentration, 游资 presence, 龙虎榜 frequency
- **Key Differentiator**: What's the single most important China-specific factor for this stock that differentiates it from peers? (e.g., "This company is the ONLY 专精特新-designated supplier for [critical component] in China")

</workflow>

<guardrails>

### Validation Gates
- Policy sensitivity matrix completed with specific policy documents referenced
- Northbound flow trend assessed (at minimum: direction and acceleration/deceleration)
- Margin balance as % of free float computed or estimated
- At least 1 龙虎榜 analysis if stock has appeared on the list in last 60 days
- Concept board membership identified
- National team positioning checked

### Constraints
<constraint>For A-share stocks, CN1+CN2 analysis is MANDATORY — do not skip</constraint>
<constraint>Policy analysis must cite specific documents (e.g., "国务院关于...的通知 [Year] No.XX"), not generic references</constraint>
<constraint>Northbound flow data must include direction and momentum — not just a static number</constraint>
<constraint>When data is unavailable, use web search and clearly state source limitations</constraint>
<constraint>Distinguish between "smart money" (机构, 北向) and "hot money" (游资) — they have very different implications</constraint>
<constraint>National team activity is often opaque — if no evidence found, state "国家队持仓未公开披露，无法确认"</constraint>

</guardrails>

### Key Concepts Reference
- **政策市 (Policy Market)**: A-share market is heavily influenced by government policy. Policy signals often matter more than fundamentals in the short term.
- **北向资金 (Northbound Capital)**: Foreign capital flowing into A-shares via Stock Connect. Generally considered "smart money" with longer holding periods.
- **游资 (Hot Money)**: Speculative capital that chases short-term trends and concept stocks. High turnover, high volatility, mean-reverting.
- **龙虎榜 (Dragon & Tiger List)**: Daily disclosure of top 5 buy/sell trading seats for stocks with unusual price movements. Critical for tracking smart vs speculative money.
- **国家队 (National Team)**: Government-linked funds that intervene in the market during stress. Their buying signals policy intent to stabilize markets.
- **专精特新 (Specialized & Sophisticated)**: Government-designated SMEs with technological specialization. Receive preferential treatment.
- **国产替代 (Domestic Substitution)**: Policy push to replace foreign technology/products with domestic alternatives. Major tailwind for qualified companies.
